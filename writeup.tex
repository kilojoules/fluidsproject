\section{Problem 4}
I implemented the PARK wake model. The velocity deficit imparted on a flow field by a wind turbine is described as
\begin{equation}
U_{def} = \frac{U_0 2a}{( 1 + \frac{ 2 k \Delta x}{D}) ^ 2}
\end{equation}
where $U_0$ is the velocity incoming to the turbine, k is the wake expansion coefficeint, $\Delta X$ is the distance downstream of the turbine, and this deficit is applied where $y_0 - \frac{D}{2} - kx < y <  y_0 + \frac{D}{2} + kx$, where $y_0$ is the location of the turbine in the cross-flow direction.
